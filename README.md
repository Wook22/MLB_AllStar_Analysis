# MLB_AllStar_Analysis
2021 MLB season

The All-Star Game is a game between teams of outstanding players and many baseball fans are interested in players to be chosen for next coming All-Star game. We made a prediction by applying effective machine learning techniques to MLB 2021 data, which was crawled from the web page. Through visualizing the data, we could understand the data better and found some meaningful insights that might improve our prediction. Since our target variable is a binary categorical variable, we used Logistic regression to train the model and we were able to get the probability of the players to be involved in the next All-Star game.

### Introduction:
Major League Baseball (MLB) is the oldest professional sports league in the world and is home to 30 teams, with 15 in the National League (NL) and 15 in the American League (AL). In this analysis, we used data from the 2021 MLB season to investigate the factors that may affect a player's nomination to the MLB All-Star game. We also created a model to predict the players most likely to be nominated for the 2022 All-Star game.


### Data Collection:
We obtained our data through web scraping techniques. We collected player data, which we then used to analyze which factors may contribute to a player's nomination to the All-Star game. The data set included a variety of variables, such as player position, team, age, years of experience, and performance metrics like Wins Above Replacement (WAR).


### Analysis:
Using linear regression analysis, we found that the most significant variables that affect a player's likelihood of being nominated to the All-Star game were WAR and years of experience. We also observed that most All-Star players were from the United States, but there were also many international players nominated. Furthermore, our logistic regression model showed that the variables of WAR, years of experience, and player position had the greatest impact on predicting which players were most likely to be nominated for the All-Star game.


### Conclusion:
Based on our analysis of the 2021 MLB season data, we have developed a model that predicts which players are most likely to be nominated for the 2022 MLB All-Star game. This analysis shows that WAR and years of experience have the strongest correlation with All-Star nominations. Our study also highlights the importance of considering a player's position and nationality when predicting All-Star selections.
